## Timeframe

- **Duration** 7 days
- **Team** This was a solo project
- **Skills** React frontend development with component-based architecture, full CRUD functionality, third-party package & service integration (Lexical text editor, Pragmatic Kanban board, Cloudinary for image uploads), and UI/UX design

## About

Catseye is a translation and project management app intended for business users who create and manage multilingual content. In my previous roles as a translator and copywriter, I used many CAT (Computer Assisted Translation) and workflow management tools that had clunky and outdated UIs. I wanted to design and build an agile and streamlined app that combined these functionalities in a simple and intuitive way, while also fostering collaboration between teams.

This was my final project on the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. Our brief was to develop a full-stack application with a React frontend that consumes a Django API. With so many interactive features to integrate, building the UI was particularly challenging and I ran into multiple issues throughout the week. I managed to resolve most of these by the project deadline and have since continued to develop the app with additional features (including AI integration).

I created the UI/UX design in Figma using a template and designed a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns. I then planned the build using a Trello board, focusing on a different feature each day.

#### 1) UI/UX design (Figma)
